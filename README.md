Colors is a website that, based on the time, it'll display a color in hex. So, from #000000 at night, to #235959 it's going to display different colors.

The roadmap for this repository is to look for ideas to show most of the colors in the hex range.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add some animations.
- [x] Add a better alignment.
- [x] Add a link to my Twitter and Github account.

Tell me your suggestion making an issue! :)
